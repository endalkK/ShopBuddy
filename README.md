# ShopBuddy
ShopBuddy is developing an autonomous smart shopping cart designed to streamline the shopping experience. The cart will be equipped with advanced navigation and computer vision technologies, allowing it to follow users, recognize items placed in the cart through barcode scanning, and seamlessly integrate with a mobile app for checkout and payment.
